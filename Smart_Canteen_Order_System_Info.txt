Smart Canteen Order System - Console-Based Python Project
----------------------------------------------------------

Project Objective:
------------------
Build a Python program that simulates a canteen ordering system where users can:
- View the menu
- Select multiple items
- Specify quantities
- Get a detailed bill with subtotal, tax, and total

Features:
---------
1. Menu Display with Categories
   - Menu has items like: samosa, chai, sandwich, noodles, thali, juice

2. Case-Insensitive Item Matching
   - User input is normalized to lowercase

3. Quantity Support
   - Users can specify how many units of an item they want

4. Running Total and Tax Calculation
   - Subtotal + 5% GST displayed

5. Final Bill with Itemized List

Skills Practiced:
-----------------
- Dictionaries and loops
- Input validation
- String formatting
- Tax and price calculations
- Improving UX in console apps

Code Logic Overview:
---------------------
- A dictionary stores the menu items and their prices.
- An empty dictionary keeps track of ordered items and their quantities.
- A loop allows the user to keep ordering until they say 'no'.
- Each valid item is added to the order dictionary.
- Quantity is validated and converted to integer.
- Final bill is generated by multiplying quantity with price, summing the subtotal, and calculating 5% GST.

Output:
-------
- Itemized list of orders
- Subtotal
- GST (5%)
- Total amount
- Thank you message

Enhancements Possible:
----------------------
- Add categories to the menu (Snacks, Drinks, etc.)
- GUI version using Tkinter
- Web app version using Flask or Streamlit
